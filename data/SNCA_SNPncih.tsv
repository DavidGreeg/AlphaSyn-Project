## Data from NCBI Variation Viewer (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/view/)
## NOTE: dbSNP and dbVar variant alleles have some columns (e.g. Variant ID, Start, etc.) in common, but others are different (e.g. Call ID, Change) and the data intermixed in the same column.
## Each row in the data below represents an allele of a dbSNP (rs) or dbVar (nsv/esv) variant.  Thus, the same RS, NSV or ESV ID may appear on multiple rows.
## Column descriptions are available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/view/help/#table.
