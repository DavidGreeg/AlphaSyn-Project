# AlphaSyn-Project
Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered in alpha-synuclein relative to their coding 
sequence and/or isoforms. Identification of codons subject to post-translational modifications (PTMs), and 
subsequent evaluation of the physiological importance of SNPs located in the afore-mentioned codons.
